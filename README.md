# User based content

This is a project created for an assignment in class FED20G at Medieinstitutet, Gothenburg. 

The application have two resources. Users and Frames(image posts). Users can have two different roles, member or admin. You can CRUD your own posts as a member. As an admin you can CRUD all posts and users. 

### Instructions 

Make sure you have mongoDB installed locally on your computer. 

To run: 
npm install 
npm start (will run both server and client scripts) 

We've prepared a .rest file where you can populate the database with some sample data. 
Open up the file /initTesting.rest and run all the endpoints from top to bottom. 

Enjoy!
